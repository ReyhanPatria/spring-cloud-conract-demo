# Contracts
A contract as defined in [Spring Cloud Contract documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/3.0.5/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-what-is-a-contract), is an agreement on how the API or message communication should look. In other words it is the agreed upon message shape that the procucer will produce and the consumer will consume.
